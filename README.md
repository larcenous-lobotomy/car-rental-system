# Introduction

The program provides a menu driven approach to implement a car rental system. A consumer can search cars based on several parameters to get the best match for him/her. The manager/admin can change stock, add/remove entries and generate a bill for the consumer.

# Instructions

Use "make all" to compile the project and "./main" to run. "make clean" can be used to remove the .o files.
