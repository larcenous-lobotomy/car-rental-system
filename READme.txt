The project compilation has been implemented using Makefile.
Use "make all" (without the quotes) to compile the project and "./main" to run. "make clean" can be used to remove the .o files.

The program provides a menu driven approach to implement a car rental system. A consumer can search cars based on several parameters to get the best match for him/her. The manager/admin can change stock, add/remove entries and generate a bill for the consumer.
